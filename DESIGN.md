# DESIGN CHOICES

## TECH:
* React
* Styled Components
* Jest

These technologies are the ones I'm most familiar with so I'm sticking to them. I chose styled components because a lot of modern React developers are using them. I also mixed in some SCSS files just to show to that I can use a standard stylesheet as well.

I divided some of the global styles up. I have a variables file that I would use to keep track of global styling like colors, margins, padding etc.

#### Why no redux? 

I didn't feel like I needed it. I'd rather just build the UI than spend a lot of time setting up Redux. If I were to expand on this app, I'd add Redux in for sure.
